# Abstract
Epidemiological models are widely used to study population-level health dynamics, and population-scale agent-based simulations have proven particularly effective in capturing the complex interactions between individual behaviors and environmental factors. However, as the number of candidate interventions, $N$, and their levels, $\ell$, grow, the computational cost of exploring the resulting exponential treatment-condition space, $\ell^N$, becomes exhaustive. In this paper, we develop a two‐level metamodel framework, comprising a Gaussian process regression (GPR) metamodel followed by a response function, to efficiently estimate county‐level treatment effects on overdose deaths per 100,000 people. In level one, we train a GPR on a sample set of simulation output, learning a smooth mapping from intervention parameters to simulated outcome for each county. To ensure robust performance, we engineered input features, including demographic and socioeconomic covariates, and employed a composite kernel that combines a radial basis function (RBF) component for smooth variation with a periodic component to capture the spatial structure of counties. In level two, the posterior means of the GPR are combined through a response function to generate outcome (i.e., overdose death rate) estimates for a given treatment condition. Using a modest training set, our two‐level metamodel achieves low relative error averaged across all treatment conditions and counties. This approach enables the rapid evaluation of intervention scenarios while significantly reducing computational time and resource requirements. This framework offers a practical decision-support tool for policymakers, enabling rapid evaluation of alternative resource allocation strategies and guiding more efficient investment in public health interventions for epidemics such as opioid use disorder.
